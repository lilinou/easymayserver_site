          Mathematics has been my passion since I was a child. The crux of mathematics is based in logic, something that I had a strong knack for even at a young age. Initially, it was my success in the subject that fueled my continued interest. As I learned more and more about the subjects of mathematics and statistics, I realized the tremendous depth and utility of the subject. The numbers and figures in any statistical study provide explanation and substance behind different stories. Thus, statistical analysis and studies can be used as a powerful tool to explain phenomena and other worldly occurrences. Furthermore, I am passionate about the subject as it acts as a light of truth that can shine even in the darkest of situations. The numbers will always display true relationships and detail an accurate account of past events. The illuminating power of math and statistics is self-evident. Understanding math and statistics is the key to ultimately understanding and using those numbers. This drove my passion to new heights.
