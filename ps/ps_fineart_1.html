        The field of SRI has grown tremendously over these past few years; according to the U.S. Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, one out of every six dollars under professional management is now invested according to SRI strategies. Wharton Social Impact Initiative (WSII) has contributed greatly to this cause. The recent researched report released by WSII shows that socially positive investments have returns as good as the market. However, there is still much more work to be done. My friend recently left his corporate job to move to Kenya to start SunCulture, a solar-powered water irrigation system that is 90% more efficient at delivering water to crops in a drought-filled area. The microfinance loans he received had so many unrealistic terms for borrowers that it was difficult for him to comply with. I believe there should not be this many impediments and that impact investing should be more accessible. I can foresee a future where SRI investments are as simple as 401(k) elections where instead of picking a pre-selected fund with an investment mix based on your target retirement age, people will be able to select causes they care about and put their assets where their heart is. At Wharton, I will lead my life every day with the conscious knowledge of my privilege and do my best with the resources I am given to advocate to those less privileged.
