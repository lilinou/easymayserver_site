            An additional phenomenal I witnessed through my experience is that of diversification. Being an equity investor in the fund, I have learned to be cautious and not overly optimistic. One should invest into many different projects in order to capture better risk adjusted monetary gains instead of always chasing the highest growth project with the maximum possible return. By doing so, stress can be minimized and success more likely achieved. After completing my classes in Macroeconomics and Statistics, I realized that the majority of these skills I gained are only technical and supporting skills and I am missing the most vital aspect: vision. After watching Professor Robert Frank’s lecture online, I have confirmed my belief that a strong vision cannot be taught from a textbook but must be gained through experience. I believe my needs can be fulfilled through the many research opportunities that are present for undergraduate students at Cornell. Being a research assistant and with access to PhD students and world renowned faculties is invaluable. Opportunities to learn about their projects and contribute through analytics and modeling would truly be a dream come true. Combined this with Cornell’s wide range of advance electives taught by professional adjuncts, I cannot fathom a more comprehensive environment for me to develop my own ideas and passion. Ultimately, Cornell will further my career in the banking and venture capital industry.
