        During my junior year, I took part in the Discovery Park Undergraduate Research internship with Professor Austin Toombs in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). The focus of the project was to analyze HCI in platforms in today’s shared economy, namely Uber and Lyft. The goal was to gain a deeper understanding of the social-technical systems behind these behemoths in today’s shared economy. The study was done from the driver’s perspective as we wanted to study and evaluate the impact of automation and technological innovation on an employee’s support and experience on the platforms as well as changes in employer responsibility. One point of interest in this research project was the work and analysis of autoethnographic data and different forms of metadata. These unconventional forms of information had to be compiled, grouped, and parsed in a fashion in order to derive quantitative metrics from them. We measured conventional statistics such as income, and overall money earned from Uber versus Lyft. In addition, we also logged overall driving summaries and tracking the frequency of request to feedback receipts, and even applied Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count analysis (LIWC) on various communications with the companies.

        From a high level, the biggest takeaway from the study was the major role that different HCI qualities played in the perceptions of the underlying companies. There were stark contrasts between the two platforms’ styles and messaging that ultimately drove that difference in perception. Further studies are warranted so we can further analyze our autoethnographic notes and explore in greater depth the linguistic differences beyond the dimensions captured by LIWC. The study also confirmed my belief that effective HCI played a critical role in creating effective automation.
