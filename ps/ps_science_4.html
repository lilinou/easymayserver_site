            My story can only start after I first take a few steps backwards. When I first stepped onto University of Georgia’s campus, I had very little idea of what I wanted to learn. I took on an eclectic sort of classes from Chemistry to Physics to History with very mixed results. Finally, I was able to gain some traction of interest after taking mathematics and Japanese classes. I liked the logic of mathematics but was uncertainty due to the vague and abstract nature of the subject. I loved my Japanese class, but wanted to ultimately major in a field that was less traditional and more innovative in application. Things started to illuminate when I took the introductory class to computer programming. Immediately, the course struck a chord with me. I was able to apply logic and reasoning to a language based class that had ever-growing worldly applications. I became hooked. As I progressed through my undergraduate years, I started learning computing and programming with unmatched fervor. I earned top grades in classes such as Systems Programming, Introduction to Theory of Computing, Software Development, and Software Engineering, just to name a few. My resulting efforts helped me achieve presidential scholar and dean’s list honors for multiple semesters.

            I continued to build upon my understanding of this field through complex academic projects. One of those that I am most proud of occurred during my Direct Study course. Specifically for this project, we were given total discretion to create an application in any language. My professor suggested an Android app as that was her expertise.  However, as an iPhone user, I wanted to create an iOS application to beautify and improve images. To do so, I had to learn the Swift language and also become acclimated with the Xcode environment. I faced a number of challenges, as the Xcode environment proved buggy while, learning the language on my own was also an obstacle. Through perseverance and relying on my previous knowledge base, I was able to deliver a final app product in the eleventh hour. I was proud of my app as it showed my ability to quickly learn and apply a new programming language as well as to push past initial complications.
