          I continued down this path further with my most recent internship with China’s Nation Bureau of Statistics. With this institution, I worked in various capacities ranging from high level analysis to meticulous maintenance of data. For example, I helped the team by using a variety of economic data to model the potential paths of Chinese unemployment rates by using multi-factor analysis and regression techniques based on industrial production, costs of living, seasonality fluctuations, labor force and population trends, amongst others. In total, over 40 factors were implemented in our model. In terms of the low level work I was also responsible for, I worked often with inflation data, gathering, normalizing, cleaning, and categorizing various inflation data from different municipalities, regarding different goods. The data sources were extensive and diverse as we drew information for the prices of countless goods from many regions. This was also an important task, as the bureau was a government entity and thus needed all its information to be correctly normalized, with high levels of integrity as these were all inputs used to create the national CPI index.
