            My grandma is an avid stock investor. When I lived with her when I was younger, I would always hear her complaint such as “I could have avoided the loss if I sold the stock a bit earlier” or “I could have made so much if I bought the stock a bit earlier”. I heard the same complaint for so many times throughout the summer that I started wondering what went wrong with people’s decision making process while trading stocks.I had a misconception that the stock market is controlled by computers. In fact, humans are the masterminds behind the stock market. There is a tendency for people to overanalyze the quantitative side of the stock market, and overlook the importance of human nature such as fear and greed, and the human decision making process. Psychology is so relevant to the topic of economics and finance; as a stock investor, I realize that I cannot maximize my return until I have a good understanding of the human thinking process. As a result, I’d like to study behavioral economics at the Wharton School.
