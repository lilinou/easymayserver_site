          Simone de Beauvoir noticed that “there is something in the New York air that makes sleep useless.” The energy of the city is undeniable. The constant bustle, the ubiquitous nature of the art and culture, and the diversity in thought all contributes to every nook and cranny of the city. Sitting at the heart of the city is NYU’s integrated campus circling Washington Square Park. That is where I want to be as I progress through the rest of my undergraduate journey. I have developed a passion for the fashion industry over the course of my adolescent life. The creativity and individualism that define the nature of the fashion industry, is what I find so compelling. Specifically, I want to apply those characteristics to the field of fashion media and communications as it merges my passion with my known abilities in communications. NYU is perfectly designed for this purpose. The school offers a tantalizing amount of flexibility in terms of limitless study options for its students. I want to structure a concentration that focuses on a mix of marketing and branding with media and communications, through an overall tilt towards the fashion industry. This resulting concentration leverages my current foundation and interests in communication, while allowing me to choose my own destiny as I pivot towards fashion industry focused subjects in these study areas. Furthermore, New York City is renowned as a fashion capital of the world. From the trendy boutiques in SoHo and glamorous designer stores on Fifth Ave, to the gritty factories in the Garment District, the fashion industry is an integral part of the city.
