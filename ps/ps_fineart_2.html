            Although financial education has been a great interest of mine, I have also displayed a knack for quantitative classes as I earned the highest honors in courses such as Mathematical Analysis III and Probabilities and Statistics. Eventually, I expanded upon my classroom knowledge by working in CICC’s quantitative trading department where I honed my analytical and technical abilities. I built a number of trading tools with VBA macros that automated various trading and market data collection processes. I also worked on FX valuation models that helped the traders to pin-point the mid-price of FX forwards using academic concepts such as covered interest rate parity. During my internship, I realized the immense impact that applied analytics had for businesses. Quantitative methods and analytics could help optimize revenue generation and lower costs. During my internship, I worked with the team to code in VBA two types of checks that helped ensured data quality. First, running a regression to pinpoint outliers greatly narrowed the amount of data to be manually checked. In addition, in incidences when there were two sources of the same data, we built simple verifications between the two sources to spot potential discrepancies for further investigation.
