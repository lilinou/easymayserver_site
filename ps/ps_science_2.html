        A loud controlled roar sounds as the engine revs up. The V-6 twin turbo engine was the source of the ruckus sound. It was audacious and powerful, with signature aesthetics. The carbon wheel arches are not only a stylistic choice, but helps strengthening the car body by making it more rigid. The iconic spoilers give the car a distinct look while also allowing the vehicle to become more aerodynamic. The Nissan GT-R is a truly an amazing feat in engineering. From a young age, I was obsessed with cars, their designs, and the way they were carefully conceived and constructed. Overtime, as I sped through my childhood and then adolescence, I discovered mechanical engineering as the driver behind the creation and design of almost all things. My interest in the subject came quickly and suddenly.

        Analysis such as that in the form of an AHP matrix had to be done before we could proceed with design; various boxes needed to be checked, such as overall functionality and quality, efficient kinetic energy capture and storage, cost of production, amongst other factors. Efficient energy capture through the blade and rotor design was the most important factor, as it would influence other factors such as costs and overall functionality. Thus, we made it a major focus. Copious amount of work was done to find the optimal target after charting angular velocity versus torque. Later on, blade design had to filter through various sub-factors such as stability and manufacturability. The beta prototype would ultimately prevent crop destruction and preserve the elephant population in Kenya. The tremendous experience reinforced my passion for the subject that also enlightened me to the possibility of creating a more sustainable world through mechanical engineering.
