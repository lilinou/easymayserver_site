        One of my favorite projects had to be my report on the MEA and MgO Carbon Capture

        effectiveness of MEA-based versus MgO-based carbon capture, from varying perspectives. For example, we implemented a net present value (NPV) model and sequential NPV sensitive analysis to tackle the issue from a cost benefit perspective. Furthermore, we also employed the Aspen model to forecast the performance of the two different carbon capture processes. I thoroughly enjoyed testing my classroom knowledge, as well leading my fellow teammates to ultimately succeed in our endeavor. However, what I appreciated most was the opportunity I had to dissect and study an issue as important as the removal of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

        Beyond my experiences on campus, I also had the opportunity to test my abilities and knowledge in the professional setting, at multiple positions in the private sector. Currently, I am working as a Facilities and EHS Intern at Alta Devices, a world leader and record holder in the solar industry. I was fortunate to take on various high exposure responsibilities such working with internal data to calculate the company’s pollutants in each product line, ultimately helping management and the company to stay within EPA regulations. Furthermore, I coordinated amongst internal factory and production departments, as well as external bodies such as the Ministry of Health and Safety to implement various safety protocols and procedures. Through my efforts, I was able to contribute to Alta’s company goal of bringing continued sustainability to our world through the use of solar power.
